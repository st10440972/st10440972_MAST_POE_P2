I have been approached by chef Christoffel to create a application.
In the application he has asked me allow him to add and remove dishes. He said he wants the app to display the dish name, description and price. For the first part of the project I have create a application with one page (home page).
On the home page you will find the header containing the logo, "Chef Christoffel's Kitchen" and a dish count (To show how many dishes are available at the time of the application use).
Body contains the dishes, in a card list stay. Each card has the dish name, description and price, and has remove button (To remove the dish on command).
At the bottom i have add a "+ Add Dish" button, to allow the chef to add new dishes to the menu.
When the chef presses "+ Add Dish" a input menu will appeare with 3 fields to fill in (Dish name, description and price). The chef MUST FILL ALL FIELDS, in order for the application to add the dish to the menu, otherwise the application will show message that are fields not filled in.
Once everything is filled in the chef will press save and the dish will be added to the menu, or cancel if he does not want to add the dish anymore.
I have also made a YouTube video demonstrating how the application works ( https://youtu.be/nPoJu7CUeEA?si=W0WulvIeCJY-b0OC )
I would also like to thank my mentor T.Tokwe for some design ideas during the completion of this project
